                  Customers impose considerable variability on the operating
                  systems of service organizations. They show up when they wish
                  (arrival variability), they ask for different things (request
                  variability), they vary in their willingness and ability to
                  help themselves (effort and capability variability), and they
                  have different preferences (subjective preference
                  variability). All this variability leaves the front lines of
                  many service organizations struggling to deliver consistent,
                  high-quality service. The Customer Compatibility Exercise
                  provides students with a window into this reality through the
                  lens of their own experiences, surfacing lessons about the
                  daunting and seemingly-incongruous task of reactively managing
                  customer relationships and efficient operations. Moreover,
                  analysis of student data provided through the exercise reveals
                  a set of proactive strategies that companies can use to pursue
                  more compatible customer relationships.

                  In Phase I of this exercise, students are invited to document
                  two of their own face-to-face interactions with service
                  providers. In Phase II, after all students have documented
                  their experience interactions, a searchable online gallery is
                  launched so that students can browse and learn from each
                  other's experiences, as well as highlight service interactions
                  they find interesting and would like to discuss in class.
                  During the third and final Phase III, certain underlying
                  trends and correlations between key attributes are identified
                  by graphical analysis of the recorded data. This final
                  analysis sets the stage for the introduction of strategies
                  companies can use to proactively cultivate more compatible
                  customer relationships, yielding delighted customers and more
                  efficient operations.
